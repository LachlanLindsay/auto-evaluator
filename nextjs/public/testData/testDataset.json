    "question": "What is the transformer and what are some of its key features?",
    "answer": "The transformer is a series of blocks with attention and a multilayer perceptron. It has residual connections, layer normalizations, soft max attention, and is designed to be optimizable and run efficiently on hardware like GPUs. It is very expressive in a forward pass and can express many different types of algorithms. The residual connections support the ability to learn short algorithms fast and first, and then gradually extend them longer during training."
