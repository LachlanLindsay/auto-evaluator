    "question": "Why is the transformer architecture expressive in the forward pass?",
    "answer": "The transformer architecture is expressive because it uses a general message passing scheme where nodes get to look at each other, decide what's interesting and then update each other.",
    "result": "The transformer architecture is expressive in the forward pass because it uses a message passing scheme where nodes get to look at each other, decide what's interesting, and then update each other. This allows the architecture to express a wide range of algorithms and computations. Additionally, the soft max attention, residual connections, and layer normalizations also contribute to the expressiveness of the architecture.",

    "question": "What design criteria does the Transformer meet?",
    "answer": "The transformer is very expressive in a forward pass, optimizable in the backward pass using the techniques that we have such as gradient descent, and it can run efficiently on our hardware such as GPUs.",
    "result": "The Transformer meets several design criteria, including being a general-purpose computer that can be trained on arbitrary problems, having a powerful architecture that allows for very general computation as message passing, being optimizable using backpropagation and gradient descent, running efficiently on hardware like GPUs, and being resilient and stable. Additionally, the Transformer supports residual connections that allow for the learning of short algorithms quickly and gradually extending them. Overall, the Transformer is designed to simultaneously optimize for many desirable properties of a neural network architecture.",

    "question": "Why is next word prediction an effective training objective?",
    "answer": "On a sufficiently large dataset, the task of predicting the next word multi-tasks knowledge of a lot of things, including understanding of chemistry, physics, and human nature. You have to understand a lot about the world to make that prediction on an internet-scale dataset.",
    "result": "Next word prediction is an effective training objective because it requires the model to understand a lot about the world in order to make accurate predictions. By training on a large dataset of text, the model is multitasking and learning about various topics such as chemistry, physics, and human nature. This results in the model developing emergent properties and surprising behaviors that make it effective at predicting the next word in a sequence. Additionally, pre-training a massive neural net on a large dataset like this can make it efficient at training on new tasks with very few examples.",

    "question": "What was the World Of Bits project and why did it fail?",
    "answer": "World Of Bits was an effort to give AI access to tools, such as a keyboard and mouse, in order to complete tasks, such as complete bookings. It failed because it turned out that reinforcement learning is an extremely inefficient way of training neural networks. You take many actions, but you only get a sparse reward once in a while. Starting from scratch, it is very unlikely to stumble on the correct action - such as a booking - by chance at random, so the reward signal is very sparse.",
    "result": "The World of Bits project was a project at OpenAI that aimed to train a reinforcement learning system to take actions on the internet, rather than just consuming it. The idea was to give neural networks access to a keyboard and a mouse and allow them to interact with the digital world. However, it is not clear from the context why the project failed or if it even failed.",

    "question": "Why can additional sensors be a liability in an autonomous vehicle system?",
    "answer": "Each sensor adds complexity to the system. The hardware must be sourced, versioned, and maintain firmware. Software must ingest it, track versions. The cost of this additional bloat or entropy must be weighted against the added benefit of that particular sensor.",
    "result": "Additional sensors can be a liability in an autonomous vehicle system because they are not free and require an entire supply chain, procurement, maintenance, and firmware writing. They can also hold back the production line and may need replacement. Moreover, incorporating them into a big fleet that collects a lot of data and integrating them with a data engine that's able to quickly find different parts of the data that then continuously improves whatever the model that you're using can be challenging. Therefore, it's essential to consider the full cost of any one sensor before adopting it and focus resources on necessary and sufficient sensors.",
