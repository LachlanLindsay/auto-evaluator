    "question": "Why is the transformer architecture expressive in the forward pass?",
    "answer": " \"The transformer architecture is expressive because it uses a general message passing scheme where nodes get to look at each other",
    "result": "The transformer architecture is expressive in the forward pass because it uses a message passing scheme where nodes get to look at each other, decide what's interesting, and then update each other. This allows it to express a wide range of algorithms and computations. Additionally, the architecture includes residual connections, layer normalizations, and soft max attention, which further enhance its expressiveness.",

    "question": "What design criteria does the Transformer meet?",
    "answer": " \"The transformer is very expressive in a forward pass",
    "result": "The Transformer meets several design criteria, including being a general-purpose computer that can be trained on arbitrary problems, having a powerful architecture that allows for very general computation as message passing, being optimizable using backpropagation and gradient descent, running efficiently on hardware like GPUs, and being resilient and stable. Additionally, the Transformer supports the ability to learn short algorithms fast and first, and then gradually extend them.",

    "question": "Why is next word prediction an effective training objective?",
    "answer": " \"On a sufficiently large dataset",
    "result": "Next word prediction is an effective training objective because it requires the model to understand a lot about the world in order to make accurate predictions. By training on a large dataset of text, the model is multitasking and learning about various topics such as chemistry, physics, and human nature. This results in the model developing emergent properties and surprising behaviors that make it effective at predicting the next word in a sequence. Additionally, pre-training a massive neural net on a large dataset like this can make it efficient at training on new tasks with very few examples.",

    "result": "The World of Bits project was a project at OpenAI that aimed to train a reinforcement learning system to take actions on the internet, rather than just consuming it. The idea was to give neural networks access to a keyboard and a mouse and allow them to interact with the digital world. However, it is not clear why the project failed, as the speaker does not mention any specific reasons for its failure.",

    "question": "Why can additional sensors be a liability in an autonomous vehicle system?",
    "answer": " \"Each sensor adds complexity to the system. The hardware must be sourced",
    "result": "Additional sensors can be a liability in an autonomous vehicle system because they are not free and require an entire supply chain, procurement, maintenance, and firmware writing. They can also hold back the production line and may need replacement. Moreover, incorporating them into a big fleet that collects a lot of data and integrating them with a data engine that's able to quickly find different parts of the data that then continuously improves whatever the model that you're using can be challenging. Therefore, it's essential to consider the full cost of any one sensor before adopting it and focus resources on necessary and sufficient sensors like vision.",
